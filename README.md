The DNA-based Identification System offers several unique features that distinguish it from traditional methods of identification, such as fingerprints or facial recognition. These features make it an exceptionally reliable and secure technology for identity verification, especially in sensitive and high-security areas.

1. Unique and Infallible Identification
DNA is unique to each individual (except in identical twins), making it an extremely accurate method for identification. The system analyzes specific regions of an individual's genetic code, which are highly variable and specific to each person. This uniqueness makes the DNA-based system nearly infallible, minimizing the risk of errors in identifying a person.

2. High Level of Accuracy
Unlike other biometric systems, such as fingerprints or iris scans, which can be influenced by external factors (like wear and tear or injuries), DNA remains unchanged throughout a person's life. This gives DNA-based identification systems a level of permanence and consistency that is unmatched by other technologies.

3. Robust Against Fraud and Tampering
Since DNA cannot be easily replicated or altered, the system is resistant to fraud, unlike traditional identification methods. Counterfeit fingerprints, photos, or facial recognition data can sometimes be manipulated, but DNA samples are extremely difficult to forge or alter, offering an additional layer of security against identity theft and fraud.

4. Non-Invasive Collection Methods
DNA samples can be collected from a variety of sources, such as blood, saliva, hair, or even skin cells. These samples are often non-invasive and can be easily obtained in a variety of settings, from criminal investigations to personal identification during border crossings. The collection process is quick and straightforward, allowing authorities to gather critical data without requiring extensive procedures.

5. Scalability and Global Applicability
The DNA-based Identification System can be implemented on a global scale. Governments worldwide can create large DNA databases for national security, law enforcement, and immigration control. This database can be linked to databases of other countries, allowing for seamless cross-border identification, crucial for combating international crime, human trafficking, and terrorism.

6. Long-Term Reliability
DNA samples remain viable for long periods, even after years or decades, unlike some other forms of identification, such as fingerprints that may degrade over time. This means that a person’s DNA profile can be stored and referenced for long-term tracking, making it a valuable tool for posthumous identification and for cases that may take years to resolve.

7. Enhanced Forensic Use
The system’s ability to use DNA for identification makes it invaluable in forensic science. It helps law enforcement agencies solve crimes by identifying criminals or victims using biological evidence found at crime scenes, even when the person has not been previously identified. It also enables identification in mass disaster scenarios, such as natural disasters or terrorist attacks, where victims may not be identifiable by traditional means.

8. Integration with Other Biometric Systems
Although DNA-based systems offer unparalleled accuracy, they can be integrated with other biometric technologies, like facial recognition, iris scans, or fingerprinting, to create a multi-layered identification process. This enhances security further by cross-referencing different biometric data points, ensuring that the identity of an individual is verified through multiple methods.

9. Privacy and Ethical Concerns Management
Despite concerns about privacy, modern DNA-based identification systems are designed with privacy protections in place. Information is often stored in encrypted, decentralized databases to minimize unauthorized access and misuse. Additionally, stringent policies can ensure that DNA data is only used for specified purposes, such as criminal investigations or border security, and not for unauthorized surveillance.

10. Global Crime Prevention and Identification
Governments and international organizations can utilize DNA identification systems to address global challenges, such as human trafficking, terrorism, and organized crime. DNA profiling allows authorities to track individuals across borders and resolve cases that involve multiple jurisdictions. DNA databases can help identify missing persons, provide quick cross-referencing of criminal records, and establish links between different crimes and suspects.

11. Posthumous Identification
In cases of natural disasters, accidents, or violent crimes, DNA can be used to identify individuals who have died, even when traditional methods of identification are not possible. The ability to identify bodies through DNA is an essential tool for authorities, enabling closure for families and helping in the identification of unknown victims in mass casualty situations.

12. Cost-Effectiveness Over Time
While the initial setup cost for DNA-based identification systems can be high, the long-term benefits outweigh the expenses. Due to the durability of DNA profiles and their permanence over time, once a person’s genetic information is cataloged, there’s no need for repeated identification attempts. This can save money for governments and organizations in the long run compared to traditional identification systems that may require regular updates or maintenance.

In conclusion, the DNA-based Identification System's unique features make it an unparalleled tool for identification, security, and forensic investigation worldwide. With its accuracy, permanence, and resistance to fraud, this system offers governments, law enforcement, and security agencies an incredibly reliable solution to safeguard both individuals and nations. Its applications continue to grow, and as technology improves, the potential for its use in securing the global community only becomes
